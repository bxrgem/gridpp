The program post-processes NetCDF files used at MET-Norway by using various
downscaling and calibration methods. Post-processed forecasts are placed in a
second Netcdf file, which has the desired output grid.

To convert between the two grids, a downscaling method is used. Currently
implemented methods are:

* nearest neighbour

* elevation gradient (interpolation to new elevations using gradients)

* smart neighbours (nearest grid points at the same elevation)

* pressure (interpolation to new elevations using a standard atmosphere)

Calibrators include:

* spatial smoothing (average within a neighbourhood)

* quantile-quantile mapping

* linear regression

* Kriging of biases at points onto a grid (additive and multiplicative)

* ensemble calibration using zero-adjusted Gamma distribution (e.g. for precipitation)

* ensemble calibration using Box-Cox t-distribution (e.g. for windspeed)

* ensemble calibration using Gaussian distribution (e.g. for temperature)

* calculation of precipitation phase, using wetbulb temperature

* calculation of QNH from surface pressure



Installation Instructions
-------------------------

**From source**

1. Ensure the following libraries are installed:

   * Boost libraries
   * Netcdf c++ library
   * libgsl0
   * libblas
   * (Optional) Google test library (if developing new code)

2. Download the source code from a release: https://github.com/metno/gridpp/releases

3. Edit CXX, CFLAGS_O, IFLAGS, and LFLAGS in makefile

4. Run 'make'

**From debian packages**

Running the program
-------------------
To see program options, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp

To test the program on a fake dataset, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp testing/files/10x10.nc testing/files/10x10_copy.nc\
      -v T -d gradient\
      -v Precip -d smart numSmart=3 searchRadius=3
   ncview testing/files/10x10_copy.nc



Running on multiple cores
-------------------------
To run using 8 threads:

.. code-block:: bash

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
   ./gridpp ...



Minimizing memory usage
-----------------------
Run the program in sequence for each variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp input output -v T ...
   ./gridpp input output -v Precip ...
   ./gridpp input output -v RH ...
